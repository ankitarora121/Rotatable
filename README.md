jQuery-UI-Rotatable
===================

Click and rotate DOM elements.  
This plugin makes use of jQuery UI to add the ability to rotate DOM elements by modifying the it `transform: matrix()` attribute.
  
Full credits to this guy: Павел Марковнин at http://vremenno.net/js/jquery-ui-rotation-using-css-transform/  
I essentially just took the script and put it on GitHub for easier updating/testing.
